Efficiency of BaseAddition question solving:
O(n):
Looping through digits and appending to the result is linear time relative to the length of the digits.
Omega(n):
Since this is a linear loop, there is nothing which can speed it up.

Efficiency of Postfix creation:
O(n):
Adding integers while there are still operators left to add is linear to the amount of operators.
Omega(n):
There is no way that this algorithm can execute quicker than linear time.
